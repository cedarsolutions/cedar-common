This is the CedarCommon project, which provides common functionality for Cedar
Solutions Java projects.  You don't actually need this project if all you want
to do it utilize the code: it's all available in Maven Central, divided up
more-or-less by source folder.

This project is managed by Gradle, and gets most of its dependencies from
Maven.  You do not need the Google Plugin for Eclipse installed to work with
this code, although it doesn't hurt anything if you want to.

Revision control for this project does not include any Eclipse project files.
Instead, those files are generated by gradle.  Install Gradle (>= 1.7) and then
execute:

    gradle CedarCommon2 eclipse

This will create all of the files, and then you'll be able to import the
project into Eclipse.

Look in the doc directory for additional documentation, including credits, etc.
There is also additional documentation on the Google Code web site.
