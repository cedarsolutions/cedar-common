This is the CedarCommon project, which provides common Java utilities as well
as specialized functionality for building GWT applications on Google App Engine
using the Mvp4g model-view-presenter framework.  The home page for this project 
is:

    http://code.google.com/p/cedar-common/  

This code was originally built along with the the SantaExchange GWT/GAE
demonstration project:

   https://code.google.com/p/santa-exchange/

All of this code is available in a Maven repository at:

    http://maven.cedar-common.googlecode.com/hg/maven/

This project is managed by Gradle, and gets most of its dependencies from
Maven.  You do not need the Google Plugin for Eclipse installed to work with
this code, although it doesn't hurt anything if you want to.

Revision control for this project does not include any Eclipse project files.
Instead, those files are generated by gradle.  Install Gradle (>= 1.7) and then
execute:

    gradle eclipse

This will create all of the files, and then you'll be able to import the
project into Eclipse.
