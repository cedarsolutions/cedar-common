This is the CedarCommon project, which provides common Java utilities as well
as specialized functionality for building GWT applications on Google App Engine
using the Mvp4g model-view-presenter framework.  The home page for this project
is:

    http://code.google.com/p/cedar-common/

This version of CedarCommon is designed for use with GWT v2.7 and later.  If
you need support for GWT v2.5 or v2.6, use the latest version of CedarCommon
v4.x (probably v4.9.2).  There is very little functional difference between
CedarCommon v4.x and v5.x, other than support for GWT v2.7.

This code was originally built along with the the SantaExchange GWT/GAE
demonstration project:

   https://code.google.com/p/santa-exchange/

All of this code is available in a Maven repository at:

    http://maven.cedar-common.googlecode.com/hg/maven/

This project is managed by Gradle, and gets most of its dependencies from
Maven.  You do not need the Google Plugin for Eclipse installed to work with
this code, although it doesn't hurt anything if you want to.

Revision control for this project does not include any Eclipse project files.
Instead, those files are generated by gradle.  Install Gradle and then
execute:

    gradle eclipse

This will create all of the files, and then you'll be able to import the
project into Eclipse.

The build scripts are written for Gradle 1.x, and will not work with Gradle
2.x.  Long-term, I want to convert to Gradle 2.x, but it's a major effort
because the interface changed.

I recommend that you install Gradle v1.12, the final release in the 1.x line:

Look in the doc directory for additional documentation, including credits, etc.
