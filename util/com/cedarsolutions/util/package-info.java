/**
 * Common utilities.
 *
 * <p>
 * Ken has been building up a set of useful utilities over the last few
 * years, and this package contains everything he thinks is worth sharing
 * between projects.  Some of it probably overlaps heavily with functionality
 * in Apache Commons or similar projects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The classes that reside directly within <code>com.cedarsolutions.util</code>
 * are not translatable to GWT client-side code.  All of the translatable utilities
 * are found in <code>com.cedarsolutions.util.gwt</code>.
