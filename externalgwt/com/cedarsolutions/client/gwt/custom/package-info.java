/**
 * Customized GWT functionality.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is standard GWT code that I have customized for my uses.  This
 * functionality has been pulled into CedarCommon under the terms of its
 * license.  See README.credits for more information.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The code was copied rather than extended because the original GWT code does
 * not faciliate extension.  GWT code is often difficult to extend due to
 * design choices like the use of private or final variables, methods, or
 * dependent classes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each class contains modified Javadoc that indicates its original source.
 * Further, the original version of each customized file has been placed into
 * the <code>doc/custom</code> folder in the source tree.  This way, it's
 * always possible to see exactly what was changed between the original and
 * customized versions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because this code is based on a specific GWT version, it might be necessary
 * to modify the code (sometimes substantially) when upgrading from one GWT
 * version to another.
 * </p>
